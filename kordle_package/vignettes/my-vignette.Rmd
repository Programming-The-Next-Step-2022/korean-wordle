### *kordle* - guess the word in Korean!

A couple months ago, there was a surge of popularity in playing
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html),a game where
you have only a few tries to guess the word. Although there
are a couple Korean versions of the game, they are not implemented in R.

The package *kordle* allows to play the word guessing game by using RShiny.
There are three functions from *kordle* that RShiny app calls.

### How *kordle* works

```{r setup,include=F}
library(kordle)
source('C:/Users/Emilija/Desktop/r_dir/kordle/kordle/wordlist.R',
         encoding = 'utf-8')
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Korean")
```

First, the target word is chosen randomly from the pre-made wordlist.

```{r}
target_word <- sample(wordlist$hangeul,1)
target_word
```
Since Korean words are made up of character blocks, it is hard, if not 
impossible, to track back which characters were types to create the word.
For example, as you type the word 'hi' (안녕), the individual characters (
ㅇ ㅏ ㄴ ㄴ ㅕ ㅇ) will change their shape and position themselves to create
the word itself.

Therefore, each word in the list comes with associated characters and a
translation:
```{r}
wordlist[wordlist$hangeul == target_word,c(1:6)]
toString(wordlist[wordlist$hangeul == target_word,8])
```

Both target and guess words are passed to the function *compare_word*,
which compares the individual characters from both words and gives feedback:

1. **correct**, if the character is both correct and in the same position

2. **close**, if the character is correct but in wrong position

3. **nope**, if the character is not in target word

```{r,eval=F}
compare_word(
    target = target_word,
    guess = guess_word
)
compare_word('친구','단근')
#>[1] "nope"    "nope"    "correct" "correct" "nope"    "close" 
```

Then, the output of *compare_word* is passed to the function *output_word*,
which takes the labelled characters and prepares for the final output.
This includes making sure the repeating characters are not marked twice and
that the final output shows each individual character with/out brackets:

1. **[]** brackets are put for **correct** characters

2. **()** brackets are put for **close** characters

3. No brackets are put for **nope** characters

```{r,eval=F}
output_word(
    target = target_word,
    guess = guess_word,
    result = compare_word(target_word,guess_word)
)
#>[1] " \u3137  \u314f [\u3134][\u3131] \u3161  \u3134 "
```

With the encoding issues, the function output does not display nice results.
However, when the function is used by RShiny App, it displays the words
without any problems.

The third function *translate_word* provides translation for the guess word:

```{r,eval=F}
translate_word(
  guess = guess_word
)

translate_word('단근')
#>[1] "carrot"
```

### How to use *kordle* on RShiny App

Although it is possible to get feedback on your guesses just by running the
functions, the main way to use *kordle* is by using RShiny.

The user can enter their guesses:

Until they get it right:
